## Key Machine Learning Definitions
> "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." - Arthur Samuel (1959)

> "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." - Tom Mitchell (1998)

## ML Paradigms
### 1. Supervised Learning
- Learning based on labeled data
- **Types**:
  - Regression: Predicts continuous output
  - Classification: Predicts discrete output

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Identifies patterns in unlabeled data
- No prior knowledge of target labels

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Agent learns by taking actions in an environment
- Maximizes cumulative reward through feedback

## Interpretability of ML Models
**Definition**: The degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision

### Interpretability Types
1. **Application-grounded**: Meaningful insights for stakeholders
2. **Human-grounded**: Aligned with human cognitive processes
3. **Functionality-grounded**: Formal approach to understanding model internals

## Data Science Methodology
### Phases
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

## Key Concepts
- **Generalization**: Model's ability to perform well on unseen data
- **Overfitting**: Model captures too much training data detail
- **Underfitting**: Model is too simple to capture data patterns
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Balancing model complexity

## Dimensionality Reduction
- Transforms high-dimensional data to lower-dimensional space
- **Functions**:
  - Reduce computational complexity
  - Improve model interpretability
  - Facilitate data visualization

## Next Session
- **Date**: 16.12.2024
