## Course Overview
1. Supervised Learning (Theoretical Foundations)
2. Multivariate Methods
3. Linear Discrimination

## Supervised Learning Foundations

### Basic Concepts
- **Training Set**: Collection of instances with corresponding labels
- **Hypothesis Class**: Set of possible models/functions
- **Classification Goal**: Predict class labels for new instances

### Important Theoretical Concepts

#### VC Dimension
- **Purpose**: Quantify complexity of a hypothesis class
- **Introduced by**: Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis
- **Key Insight**: Measures model's capacity to fit various functions

#### Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Learning
- Defines mathematical relationship between:
  - Number of training samples
  - Error rate
  - Probability of achieving desired error rate

### Model Selection Considerations
- **Trade-offs**:
  1. Complexity of hypothesis space
  2. Training set size
  3. Generalization error

## Multivariate Methods

### Multivariate Normal Distribution
- **Strengths**:
  - Easy parameter estimation
  - Explicit statistical representation
  - Can generate synthetic data
  - Compute distribution similarities

- **Weaknesses**:
  - Often oversimplified
  - Sensitive to outliers
  - Assumes unimodal distribution

### Parameter Estimation
- **Sample Mean**: Average of observations
- **Sample Covariance**: Measure of feature variability and correlation
- **Correlation Matrix**: Standardized covariance

## Linear Discrimination

### Key Approaches
1. **Likelihood-based Classification**
   - Assume model for p(x|Ci)
   - Use Bayes' rule to calculate probabilities

2. **Discriminant-based Classification**
   - Model decision boundaries directly
   - No need for precise density estimation

### Logistic Regression
- **Motivation**: Learn decision boundaries for general cases
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses sigmoid function
  - Continuous and differentiable
  - Allows probabilistic predictions

### Gradient Descent
- **Purpose**: Optimize model parameters
- **Process**: Iteratively update weights in negative gradient direction
- **Key for**: Logistic regression training

## Summary of Approaches
- **Parametric Models** (Multivariate Normal):
  - Explicit distributions
  - More interpretable
  - Potentially less accurate

- **Linear Discrimination**:
  - Focuses on conditional class likelihoods
  - More robust
  - Supports diverse feature types
  - Logistic regression as a baseline method

## Next Meeting Topics
- Non-parametric Methods
- Decision Trees
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Machine Learning Experiment Design
